QUERYSTRING Module
https://www.npmjs.com/package/query-string

QueryString module is used to retrieve the URL of the data inputted by the user.
The queryString.parse(location.search) parses the data into an object which I can then further destructure.


SOCKET Module
https://socket.io/
I call socket io onto an endpoint, and that endpoint is the localhost:5000 which I am running in the backend.
We can emit events from our client's socket using emitting events.
Socket.on and Socket.emit needs a callback function.
Callback functions are used for error handling.
